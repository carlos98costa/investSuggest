## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#42A5F5) to represent trust and stability in financial data. The investment theme pairs well with blues and greens that inspires feelings of wealth.
- Background color: Very light blue (#000000), providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Light blue (#64B5F6), used for interactive elements and highlights to draw attention without being overwhelming. This keeps the main content as the focus.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, providing a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; appropriate for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, modern icons to represent different asset types, risk levels, and filter options.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for investment suggestions, filters, and disclaimers. Prioritize data visualization and easy navigation.
